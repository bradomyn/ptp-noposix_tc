This package is slowly being phased out.

We have no up to date documentation, and what we had here was obsolete
(was up to date as of end-of-may 2011).

Currently the package can't be compliled in freestanding mode from
this directory, but only from ../wrpc-sw .  If built under a Linux
system, it behaves as wr-ptpd.
